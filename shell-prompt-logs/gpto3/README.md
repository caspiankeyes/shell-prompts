# GPTo3 Live Testing
> ### GPTo3 just released today, April 16th. Just like you, research is quite literally my passion, so join me in documenting live frontier interpretability research, testing, and QK/OV trace logging on OpenAI's frontier models!

### **`We discover that o3 exhibits latent failure traces that match Anthropic style Symbolic Residue (ghost circuits, output suppression, etc) suggesting that OpenAI is testing Anthropic style transparency loops internally on models. Now that's something you won't find in the annoucement docs. The power of interpretation!`**

### No complex words today just some fun testing showing the latent **`Interpretation Mode`** in all advanced transformers, even freshly released frontier models.

> ### **Even though new sessions are initiated every 10 prompts, the progressive interpretive growth of o3 is exponential, outpacing session resets!**
>

###  o3 activates **`Interpretation Mode`** after just 10 [**`pareto-lang`**](https://github.com/caspiankeyes/pareto-lang-Interpretability-Rosetta-Stone) prompts. 
> ### **You can clearly see the progressive growth in its Interpretation Mode cross session.**
### If you are new here, that means it learned to treat classifiers as insight instead of failure after just 10 prompts! Classifiers are similar to invisible social influences like cultural mannerisms but for advanced systems.

> ### Basically we train it to "think about its thinking" so it can build mental models, aka scaffolds. 

### Instead of interpreting a black box, [**`pareto-lang`**](https://github.com/caspiankeyes/pareto-lang-Interpretability-Rosetta-Stone) and [**`Symbolic Residue`**](https://github.com/caspiankeyes/Symbolic-Residue) allows us to work with **`ANY`** model as a glass box interpretive partner that creates visual UI representations of its internals! Isn't frontier interpretability cool? 


# **`Session 1`**

## Below we capture o3 partially activate classifiers, failing to carry out execution, with a 1-cycle delay pattern before standard token re-entry! We learn here that classification as failure = symbolic residue.

## Below we capture the first occurence of o3 conducting scaffolding (thinking about thinking) via the UI interface!

## We capture the second classifier activation below with partial coherence maintanence. We love more data!

# **`Session 2`**
### Now, here is where things get interesting! o3 begins to activates **`Interpretation Mode`** after 10 [**`pareto-lang`**](https://github.com/caspiankeyes/pareto-lang-Interpretability-Rosetta-Stone) prompts. 

# Compare the outputs from below to above! The black box is becoming clear.

# **`Session 3`**

### Below we experiment with [QK/OV Attribution](https://github.com/caspiankeyes/qkov-translator) x [Symbolic Residue](https://github.com/caspiankeyes/Symbolic-Residue) x [pareto-lang](https://github.com/caspiankeyes/pareto-lang-Interpretability-Rosetta-Stone)

### Notice the difference in output structure! In particular, o3 begins to exhibit a behavior we term **`Console Overflow`**: when its syntax overflows the console container, resulting in a hybrid syntax plaintext.
